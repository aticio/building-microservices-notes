Consider [[microservice]]s are an alternative approach to monolith architectures. Monolith means all the functionality are deployed together.

* Single process monolith: All the code deployed in a single process.
* Modular monolith: Single process consist of seperate modules. Each module can be worked on independently but all still need to be combined together for deployment.
* Distributed monolith: Consiste of multiple services but entire system must be deployed together.
